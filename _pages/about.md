My name is Aaron Match. I am an atmospheric scientist with a focus on stratospheric dynamics and climate science. In am an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences working with Professor Ed Gerber at New York University. 

I defended my Ph.D. in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Princeton University advised by Stephan Fueglistaler in April 2021. My dissertation was titled: &quot;The Unified Internal Dynamics and Global Interactions of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation&quot;. Before coming to Princeton, I completed a B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. I am originally from Harrisburg, PA, where I gained an early appreciation for model uncertainty when striving to forecast a week in advance when I would be able to build snow forts.

I help bring climate science directly to the public with my colleagues at [Climate Up Close](http://www.climateupclose.org).
