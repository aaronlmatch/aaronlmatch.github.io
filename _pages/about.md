I am an atmospheric scientist working on stratospheric dynamics, photochemistry, and transport. 

I develop theory and simple models for understanding the stratosphere. These models clarify how to think about the structure of the stratosphere and its response to perturbations, and facilitate the interpretation of observations and global climate models. I have developed a new explanation for how transport and photochemistry lead to the observed shape of the tropical ozone profile, clarifying how ozone responds to perturbations. This work has highlighted the essential role played by tropospheric expansion in the ozone response to surface warming. This work also advances understanding of photochemical adjustment, which is the process by which the ozone layer adjusts to perturbations through a downward cascade of anomalies in ultraviolet radiation and ozone. I have also developed a new explanation for why the tropical Quasi-Biennial Oscillation vanishes around 70 hPa, clarifying the response to global warming.

In October 2024, I began as a postdoctoral researcher working with Peter Hitchcock at Cornell University. We are working on an NSF-funded project that we co-wrote along with co-PI Jonathan Lin called "From surface warming to stratospheric change", in which we seek to understand how surface warming---both mean and patterned---affects the tropical tropopause layer and stratosphere, thinking carefully about the roles of convection, waves, ozone, and water vapor. 

Before this, I was an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences with Ed Gerber at New York University. We analyzed the ozone layer, including its basic structure and response to perturbations such as ozone-depleting substances and global warming. We developed new theoretical understanding of why tropical ozone has an interior maximum, how the ozone layer adjusts photochemically to perturbations, and how tropospheric expansion is essential to understanding the ozone layer response to surface warming.

My Ph.D. is in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from Princeton University where I was advised by Stephan Fueglistaler. We revisited why the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation vanishes below 70 hPa. The accepted interpretation based on the classical QBO model was found to rely on circular reasoning concerning the lower boundary condition. Breaking the circularity led us to realize that the QBO in the lowermost stratosphere vanishes because it is damped by lateral momentum exchange. Under global warming, this lower boundary should shift upwards along with the expanding troposphere, leading to a weakening of the QBO at any given altitude, yet the large internal variability of the QBO appears to have obscured this signal thus far.

I am the Community Lead for Working Group 3 of Quasi-biennial oscillation and Ozone Chemistry interactions in the Atmosphere (QUOCA), focused on Analytical Models and Linearized Ozone Parameterizations. Reach out if you want to contribute to this activity.

I perform climate outreach with scientific colleagues through the organization I co-founded called [Climate Up Close](https://www.climateupclose.org/).
