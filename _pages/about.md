I am an atmospheric scientist with a focus on stratospheric dynamics, photochemistry, and transport. My work scrutinizes mechanistic explanations for emergent climate phenomena. I have focused on the bottom of the hierarchy of climate models, working to improve the occasional instances in which our conceptual explanations for atmospheric phenomena (i.e., how we think about the atmosphere) do not align with the quantitative theories on which they are nominally based. Questions like: Why does tropical ozone have an interior maximum? How does photochemistry lead to cascading responses of the ozone layer to perturbations? Why does the tropical Quasi-Biennial Oscillation vanish below 70 hPa? These results have implications for interpreting comprehensive atmospheric models and understanding the climate response to perturbations such as global warming and ozone depletion.

In October 2024, I began as a postdoctoral researcher working with Peter Hitchcock at Cornell University. We are working on a project called "From surface warming to stratospheric change", in which we seek to understand how surface warming---both mean and patterned---affects the tropical tropopause layer and stratosphere, thinking carefully about the roles of convection, waves, ozone, and water vapor. 

Before this, I was an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences with Ed Gerber at New York University. We analyzed the ozone layer, including its basic structure and response to perturbations such as ozone-depleting substances and global warming. We developed new theoretical understanding of why tropical ozone has an interior maximum, how the ozone layer adjusts photochemically to perturbations, and how tropospheric expansion is essential to understanding the ozone layer response to surface warming.

My Ph.D. is in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from Princeton University where I was advised by Stephan Fueglistaler. We revisited why the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation vanishes below 70 hPa. The accepted interpretation based on the classical QBO model was found to rely on circular reasoning concerning the lower boundary condition. Breaking the circularity led us to realize that the QBO in the lowermost stratosphere vanishes because it is damped by lateral momentum exchange. Under global warming, this lower boundary should shift upwards along with the expanding troposphere, leading to a weakening of the QBO at any given altitude, yet the large internal variability of the QBO appears to have obscured this signal thus far.

I perform climate outreach with colleagues through [Climate Up Close](https://www.climateupclose.org/).
