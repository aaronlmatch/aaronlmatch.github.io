In 2019, I co-founded Climate Up Close to make the essentials of climate science accessible to a broad audience. Climate Up Close is a group of climate scientists who curate the scientific consensus on climate change and present our understanding face-to-face, mainly through a one-week tour each year. Our presentations are nonpartisan, nonprescriptive, and nonjudgmental. We emphasize what climate scientists do and don't know about climate change, focusing on extreme weather and what the future holds. We welcome audiences with diverse views and provide a science-based, common language for grappling with the thorny questions involving our climate future.
