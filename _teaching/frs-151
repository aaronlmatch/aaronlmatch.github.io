I assisted Professor Emeritus Rob Socolow in teaching "Time Capsules for Climate Change, to be Opened at Your Reunions", a first-year seminar in which students choose a topic relatable to climate change, and then write a time capsule essay describing two opposing scenarios for how the topic might develop at timepoints corresponding to when the students will open them at their graduation, 10-, 25-, and 50-year reunions. 

In addition to attending all lectures and co-reviewing all assignments with Professor Socolow, I delivered a pair of lectures on short-range forecasting, long-term forecasting, and guided the students through reading their first scientific papers (on the discovery of the stratosphere, the discovery of the ozone hole, and the discovery of recent CFC-11 emissions).
